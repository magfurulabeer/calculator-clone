# calculator-clone
An iOS Calculator clone I did for The Odin Project & freeCodeCamp

## Features
* An iOS Calculator Clone.
* You can do basic operations.
* You can chain operations.
* You can add a decimal to a number (only once per number)
* You can convert the current number into a percent
* You can toggle whether current number is negative
* You can clear everything
* The font will get smaller to accommodate longer numbers
* Similar to iOS calculator, larger number converted to scientific notation (Not exactly same way as the iOS app)
* Also, the home button is an easter egg that put random quotes on the screen.
* Certain numbers on the screen will make the home button give scripted quote (ex. 3.14 will give "Happy PI day!")
